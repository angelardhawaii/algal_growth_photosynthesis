# algal_growth_photosynthesis

This project contains the script that runs the final step in analysis for the PAM and growth rate data that was produced during the nutrient
and temperature experiments on Ulva lactuca and Hypnea musciformis.

The data that must be read in is located in the input folder and was generated by the script in the phytotools_alpha_ek project 
called ps_script_clean_to_ek_alpha.R

The markdown files show the results of the multiple species mixed model analysis
